### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Follow the coding standards** outlined below
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly
4. **Update documentation** if needed (README, docstrings, etc.)
5. **Write a clear commit message** describing your changes

#### Coding Standards

This project follows these principles:

- **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself): Avoid code duplication
- **LEGO**: Build modular, composable components
- **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Prefer simple, readable solutions
- **Type Hints**: Include type annotations for function signatures
- **Docstrings**: Document all public classes and methods

##### Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) Python style guide
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic

##### Example

```python
def process_image(
    img: Image.Image,
    brightness: float,
    contrast: float
) -> Image.Image:
    """
    Process image with brightness and contrast adjustments.

    Args:
        img: Source image
        brightness: Brightness multiplier (1.0 = no change)
        contrast: Contrast multiplier (1.0 = no change)

    Returns:
        Processed image
    """
    # Apply brightness enhancement
    enhancer = ImageEnhance.Brightness(img)
    img = enhancer.enhance(brightness)

    # Apply contrast enhancement
    enhancer = ImageEnhance.Contrast(img)
    img = enhancer.enhance(contrast)

    return img
```

### Testing

Before submitting a pull request, test your changes with various configurations:

```bash
# Test basic functionality
python3 ascii_art.py test_image.jpg

# Test different sizes
python3 ascii_art.py test_image.jpg -w 40 -s 55
python3 ascii_art.py test_image.jpg -w 120 -s 18

# Test randomization toggle
python3 ascii_art.py test_image.jpg --no-random

# Test bold toggle
python3 ascii_art.py test_image.jpg --no-bold

# Test brightness/contrast
python3 ascii_art.py test_image.jpg -b 2.0 -c 1.5
```

### Documentation

- Update README.md if you add new features
- Add docstrings to new functions/classes
- Update help text in argparse if you add CLI arguments
- Add examples for new features
